// To implement authorization with SMS/Email in a registration page using JavaScript, you will need to integrate with a third-party service that provides this functionality, such as Twilio or SendGrid.

// Here's a basic outline of how you might implement this:

// Create a registration form that collects the user's email or phone number, along with any other required information.
// When the user submits the form, send a request to your server to create a new user account and generate a verification code.
// Use the third-party service to send an SMS or email to the user's provided phone number or email address containing the verification code.
// Once the user receives the verification code, prompt them to enter it on your registration page.
// Send a request to your server to verify the code.
// If the code is valid, complete the registration process and log the user in.
// Here's some sample code to give you an idea of how this might look:

// javascript
// Copy code
// Send a verification code to the user's email or phone number
function sendVerificationCode(emailOrPhone) {
  // Use a third-party service like Twilio or SendGrid to send an SMS or email
  // containing the verification code to the user's email or phone number
}

// Verify the user's entered code
function verifyCode(code) {
  // Send a request to your server to verify the code
  // If the code is valid, complete the registration process and log the user in
  // If the code is invalid, display an error message and prompt the user to try again
}

// Handle form submission
function handleFormSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  // Get form data
  const emailOrPhone = document.getElementById("emailOrPhone").value;
  const password = document.getElementById("password").value;

  // Create new user account and generate verification code
  const user = {
    emailOrPhone,
    password,
  };
  const verificationCode = generateVerificationCode();
  sendVerificationCode(emailOrPhone, verificationCode);

  // Prompt user to enter verification code
  const enteredCode = prompt(
    "Please enter the verification code we sent to your email or phone number:"
  );
  verifyCode(enteredCode);
}

// Add event listener to form submit button
const formSubmitButton = document.getElementById("formSubmitButton");
formSubmitButton.addEventListener("click", handleFormSubmit);
